This is a dash app that allows the user to analyze and visualize breast tumor related variables, both for 'normal' and 'worst' types of tumors.
Through bootstraping, statistical t-tests of distributions of 'normal' and 'worst' type of tumors are dinamically generated for the variable selected.
It also includes a machine learning model that allows the user to predict a specific case's diagnosis based on a certain selection of tumor-related features.
